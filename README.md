# Xenon

![](Xenon.jpg)

The repo contains the original C++ source code and graphics of the Bitmap Brothers Xenon. This version was a Personal Computer Format (PC Format) magazine project game, from the year 2000. It was featured in the magazine and given away on a number of cover discs.
<br>
Also you will find two Typescript conversions of the game, the original conversion from C++ to Typescript was written using Visual Studio, whilst a slightly updated version that builds & runs using VSCode and a newer version of Typescript, was added in 2023.
